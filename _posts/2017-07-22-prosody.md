O.K., that's enough ranting about the W3C. Especially since I believe what they're doing is extremely valuable in that it allows not just one but two vibrant markets to survive â€” websites and browsers. Their open standards not only people to easily publish their knowledge and entertain for pennies (if that), but it also allows new operating systems to incorporate that value in a way that best works with their User eXperience (UX). Ofcourse it also allows third parties to build their own browsers to keep us on our toes, despite the lack of value they tend to place on a native UX. 

## Prosody Templating Language

So now let's discuss Odysseus itself, specifically a templating language I wrote for it I call "[Prosody](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosody_(linguistics))". I use this language to generate internal pages for Odysseus (error pages, view source, and whatnot), and hope to one day soon integrate it with [SQLite](https://sqlite.org/) to aid the development of useful navigation aids.
