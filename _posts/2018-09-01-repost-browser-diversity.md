## [The Ecological Impact of Browser Diversity](https://css-tricks.com/the-ecological-impact-of-browser-diversity/)

This post does a great job describing my experience interacting with browser engines.

The main comment I have is that I don't like the fact that browser engines are so complex, but I really can't blame them for it. Rather I blame the plethora of web standards they're expected to implement by people who don't understand how complex these browser engines are.

As I said before I'd be interested in experimenting with how this situation could be improved. But no individual alone can undertake this experiment and I'd need to find like-minded collaborators first.
