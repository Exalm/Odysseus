As I've [blogged before](/dev/2018/08/31/webfeed-previewer.html) I deeply believe you shouldn't have to rely on some central service, waste your time revisiting websites, or provide your contact information in order to keep up to date with your favourite websites. Subscribing for updates [must be](https://blogg.forteller.net/2013/first-steps/) trivial and private.

Which is why I'm proud to announce that Odysseus now supports webfeed autodiscovery! In just two clicks you can be subscribed to a webpage's feed in [Liferea](https://lzone.de/liferea/), [QuiteRSS](https://quiterss.org/), or [Akregator](https://kontact.kde.org/components/akregator.html)! I am keen to add support for more feedreaders including [Vocal](https://vocalproject.net/), but they'll need to add the code for it.

And if you don't have one of those installed, Odysseus [will recommend](odysseus:feedreaders) these apps when you try to subscribe somewhere.

I recommend web and application developers read over my [new documentation](/developer/) in order to ensure their software works best with Odysseus.

That was just a quick update, and soon I'll be getting to the truly interesting stuff!
