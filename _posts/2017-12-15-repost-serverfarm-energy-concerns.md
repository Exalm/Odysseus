# [If You Are Going To Worry About Bitcoin's Energy Consumption, Worry About Server Farms Too -- For More Than One Reason](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20171213/03424038794/if-you-are-going-to-worry-about-bitcoins-energy-consumption-worry-about-server-farms-too-more-than-one-reason.shtml)

This is a concern that I am quite curious as to whether it's a problem and what can be done about it. Can a peer-to-peer Internet be more power-efficient and green then the current hub-and-spoke architecture? As far as I know it's very difficult to measure, but the solutions to that potential problem are also better in other ways and are in my eye more [innovative](https://ar.al/notes/privacy-as-innovation/). 

I am keen to experiment with some of this "distributed"/"[egalitarian](https://mastodon.ar.al/@aral/99036879877897705)" technology to deliver rare but important features to Odysseus:

* Permalinks — Pages die relatively quickly on the modern web, and any links you share may not look the same between recipients. This feature helps to address that shortcoming.
* Bookmark sharing — One important means to discover webpages is through word-of-mouth, and while there certainly are extremely popular services which help facilitates this, browsers could aid it more themselves.
* Personalized Suggestions — Another important means to discover webpages is by having the Internet suggest things just few you. Currently this is handled by having popular content hosts suggest you some of their pages to you, but this creates it's own problems<sup title="It only serves their site, not the web; it requires intense tracking and privacy invasion; ads may bias it; etc">1</sup>. With great care, it'd be better for this to be a browser feature.
