Odysseus is now in the elementary AppCenter, and I quickly got one [interested surfer](https://github.com/WebShapedBiz) who acted as a bit of a tester. However it appears AppCenter isn't seeing my application metadata, but I've got an attempted fix for that in the pipeline. Perhaps it's for the best as that gives me a chance to take WebShapedBiz's feedback before it gets seriously promoted in AppCenter's new app carousel.

That said I created Odysseus because I personally wanted a more native-looking browser to use with elementary OS, and I'm very excited to be sharing it with others. Furthermore I appreciate elementary OS's boldness in usability improvements, and am keen to bring that same boldness to Odysseus as it becomes a more fully-featured browser whilst [keeping it's simplicity](https://elementary.io/docs/human-interface-guidelines#design-philosophy).

P.S. I am quite interested in the question of whether there are more convenient, powerful, and simpler [ways](https://github.com/alcinnz/Project-Scavange) to find and share information online, and if by totally redesigning the experience it would become possible to embrace the [Indie Manifesto](https://ind.ie/ethical-design/). This gave me the extra reason I needed to create Odysseus, and target it to an audience I know would be the most receptive to this sort of experimentation. An audience, again, that I am part of.
