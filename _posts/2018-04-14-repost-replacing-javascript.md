Today I came across a fantastic artical through [the fediverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse).

# [Let's Replace JavaScript With Something Better](https://john.ankarstrom.se/english/texts/replacing-javascript/)

And I would encourage webdevs to take John Ankarström up on this, as I would love to be able to disable JavaScript in Odysseus. But I can't do so without breaking most webpages out there, though I am considering allowing you to disable it globally and reenable it on a persite basis.

And I do think it would be interesting fork [Servo](https://servo.org/) to experiment implementing some of these ideas at the level of a browser engine. And maybe if I have a proposal for how to manipulate the DOM without [resorting to scripting](https://alcinnz.github.io/Odysseus/misc/2017/09/25/web-redesign.html), I'll blog about it.
