## [How to Build a Low-tech Website?](https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2018/09/how-to-build-a-lowtech-website/)
This is a very interesting read about the impact on energy demand the way we consume and even publish websites impacts the environment via electricity demand. It's very valuable reading for an web, or web-adjacent, developer. I find it inspiring.

Also, what an interesting idea! Rather than trying to keep your website constantly online and inevitably relying on fossil fuels at times to do so, give your visitors an indication of your server's battery charge so they can be prepared for when it does go offline! You don't even need to make this display as dominant as they have done.
