## First!

I wanted a place to comment on the development of the Odysseus web browser, and any web standards of particular note. For that reason I started this blog. 

### Odysseus values

To give you an idea of where I'm coming from on this blog, I will take the chance to explain my values in regard to the Web. 

Most predominantly I believe users should have [full control over the software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-software-even-more-important.html) that runs on their computer.

I also think the greatest feature of the Web is the ability to view a page's source, and also that this feature is vital to maintain user control. This can be seen in Odysseus as you can view the source of even the "view source" pages. 

Finally as mentioned in the project README I believe users should have control over their private data (of which control of their software is a prerequisite), and that may come up on this blog.
