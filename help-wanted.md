Please help make Odysseus the best browser for those brave enough to try it! Programming skills not required.

  <dt>Support Others</dt>
  <dd>Feel free to answer questions others have asked in <a href="https://github.com/Odysseus-support">Odysseus's support forum</a>. This on it's own is a great help!</dd>
  <dt>Artists</dt>
  <dd>Odysseus's icon and websites were developed without an understanding of the concerns of visual design. So if you do understand those concerns, please review and improve our branding. If there's miraculously no issues with it, please comment on this page telling me so.</dd>
  <dt>Linguists</dt>
  <dd>Odysseus is fully internationalized, so please go to Transifax to localize it.</dd>
  <dt>Librarians</dt>
  <dd>Do you enjoy making <a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome">Awesome Lists</a>? Or do you have an awesome bookmarks collection? Then Odysseus could *really* use you.</dd>
  <dd>If that's you show us your skill by sorting through our <a href="https://github.com/alcinnz/Odysseus-recommendations/">recommended links</a>. Add to it, remove links cluttering it up, and discuss other's suggestions. Then if you become invaluable doing that, you may be relied upon to help the transition to a new presentation of these links.</dd>
  <dt>Coders</dt>
  <dd><a href="https://github.com/alcinnz/Odysseus/">Odysseus</a> is free and open source software on GitHub, and welcomes your contributions!</dd>

If you do a great job at any of these tasks, you may be asked to write a blog post for Odysseus.
