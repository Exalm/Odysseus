{# Displayed when certificate validation fails.
    Most browsers communicate this [fairly poorly](https://blogs.gnome.org/mcatanzaro/2016/03/12/do-you-trust-this-website/), so I get right to the point that (in nontechnical language) there might be a man-in-the-middle attack.

    Furthermore the psuedo-conversation users must engage in to bypass this warning clearly indicates the danger (adding an extra step to indicate this) and when it is appropriate to bypass this security check (that is bypass for sites you DO NOT trust, not for ones you do).

    In case users want the technical details, a link to Wikipedia is provided. #}
