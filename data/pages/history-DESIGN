Why is odysseus:history designed the way it is?

As mentioned in the file, my main goal is to make it make it easy for your eyes
to land on the correct entry. And secondly I'm guided by an assumption that
surfers have some idea of what they are looking for.

And to do so (help you find the right entry) I make use of emphasis to highlight
changes in the hours/day/month/year the page was visited, and use colour to give
some indication of traversals between pages. Limiting these indicators to
typography reduces visual noise and leaves the focus on the actual content.

The paging was added to handle a freeze caused by WebKit struggling to read in
your full browser history (rendered to HTML) in a single go. A date range is
added to the header in part because it's easier to design around the flakiness of
the first iteration of the {% ifchanged %} tag in this way then to actually fix
it. But also it helps to indicate whether the page your looking for will be on
this page. For similar reasons the pagination links are tooltipped with their
date ranges to help surfers find the correct one to click, but otherwise they
need no label - just a mark.

Search was added so surfers can tell the computer what that idea of what they
want to find again, and screenshots were added to give an indication of whether
they've found the right entry.
