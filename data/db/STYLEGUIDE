1. All column names should be lower case with words seperated by underscores.
2. A line of text should never exceed 80 characters (this is good typography not
    just a limitation of old technology).
3. If a SQL clause is manually wrapped to be within 80 characters, the lines
    comprising that clause should be indented by 4 spaces.
4. The body of a template tag should be indented a further 4 spaces.

And because we're using SQLite, who have promised not to change their SQL syntax
out from under us:
1. Don't bother specifying column types - SQLite largely ignores them.
2. Don't bother specifying a primary key - SQLite provides one called "ROWID"
    for it's indices to reference unless you tell it not to.
