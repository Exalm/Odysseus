title: Tabbed web browsing

Between Odysseus's toolbar and the webpage you're currently viewing, there is a "tabbar". This can be used to keep many webpages open within the same window.

In this "tabbar" there are pairs of labels and icons (called "tabs") representing each webpage currently open in that window. Click one to switch to viewing it's page, and it will visually indicate it's selected status. If there's too many tabs open to show them all at once arrow buttons will render on either side of them. Click them to navigate to the tab immediately before or after the selected one.

Upon selecting or hovering over a tab you will see ![x](icon:16/window-close-symbolic). Click it to close the tab. Right-click the tab for more options, of which only the "Pin" option is worth describing in more detail. It renders the tab to the left of all other "non-pinned" tabs and renders it compactly as only the icon.

To the left of all tabs you will see ![+](icon:16/list-add-symbolic). Click it to add a new tab to the tabbar, so you can have yet one more page simultaneously open in that same window. And if you accidentally close a tab, you can reopen it again by clicking the ![open recents button](icon:16/document-open-recent-symbolic) to the right of all tabs and select your accidentally closed tab from the dropdown menu.

The controls in the toolbar above this tabbar refer only to the currently selected tab, and not any of the others.
