title: Navigating to pages using the "addressbar"
---

In the center of Odysseus's toolbars is it's "addressbar". Using it you can see what webpage you're on, see how much of it has downloaded, and specify a new page to visit.

To it's left you see an icon provided the current website to represent itself. This is a full-color version of the icons used in the tabbar. And next to it you can see some text specifying what website and page you're viewing. As that page downloads you'll see a progressbar in the background indicating how much of it has downloaded.

Clicking the addressbar selects all it's text for easy copy-and-paste, and anything you type in it may be interpreted in multiple ways. In order of precedence this includes:

1. A web address. If you don't specify how the page should be fetched, Odysseus defaults to HTTPS.
2. Autocompletes to a page you've visited previously.
3. A [DuckDuckGo](https://ddg.gg/) websearch.
4. Autocompletions provided by DuckDuckGo are suggested, but only if what you're typing is obviously a search (i.e. it has a space in it).

You can select any of these options from the dropdown that appears as you type.
